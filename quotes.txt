do you need a reason not to want to lose?
when you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change
follow your plan, not your mood
life is short, make it great
you weren't made to be average
comfort is a slow killer
becoming aware of your limitations changes how you see and think about everything
the days you don't quit are the ones that build you
a lack of logic can destroy any plan
take out the wishful thinking in your thought process
right now, right here. surpass your limits. there is no other way
learn who you are, unlearn who they told you to be
no more waiting. your time is now
you don't need to announce every move
pressure creates diamond or dust. you choose
change can only begin when you tear down everything you were before
life does not wait for you to be okay
the best revenge is to simply improve yourself
comfort is the enemy of ambition
let them watch as you conquer
comeback season has no audience
you weren't made to blend in
discipline over feelings, every time
i don't raise my voice. i raise my standards
